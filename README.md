**Hey!** Documentation can be found at -> [https://üçâ.docs.oxvs.net/](https://üçâ.docs.oxvs.net/)

## About

- WatermelonJS might only a simple client side router at the moment, but it is still very powerful! WatermelonJS should work in every browser. If not, feel free to help contribute!
- Watermelon is tiny! ~5KB after TypeScript compile!

## Usage

Watermelon can be quickly created by importing it as a module in the head of the document.

```html
<head>
    <script defer type="module">
        import Watermelon from "path_to_watermelon_.js";

        const router = new Watermelon({
            log: true,
            preload: true,
            hoverOnly: true,
        });
    </script>
</head>
```

### Options

- `preload` Watermelon will automatically fetch **all** links on the page
- `hoverOnly` Watermelon will only fetch links whenever the user hovers over them
- `log` Watermelon will log *almost* everything into the console. Useful for debugging!

## Notes

Watermelon is very unstable! I don't recommend you use it in a production app until I decide what I want to do with this.
